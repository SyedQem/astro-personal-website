## Overview
A database-backed project that's built around a health and fitness domain using PostgreSQL and a Java Object Relational Mapping. The focus was to design a clean, normalized relational schema that enforces data integrity, and supports realistic queries that would reflect real-world usage.

## What I built
- A normalized relational schema that models core domain entities along with their relationships
- ORM-based entity models to map domain objects neatly to relational tables
- SQL queries that represent practical real-life workflows such as tracking, summaries, and reporting

## Design notes
- **Normalization-first:** designed tables to reduce data redundancy and prevent update anomalies that can occur.
- **Integrity at database layer:** enforced correctness using keys, constraints, and relationships.
- **ORM as a bridge:** used object relational mapping to balance object-oriented code with relational structure rather than hiding the database.

## Highlights
- Utilized PostgreSQL to support structured relational data with strong integrity guarantees
- Designed schema and queries around realistic access patterns rather than purely academic examples
