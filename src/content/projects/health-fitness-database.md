## Overview
A relational database designed around a health and fitness domain, built to model real-world entities cleanly and support meaningful queries. The focus was correctness, integrity, and designing a schema that stays maintainable as the system grows.

## What I built
- A structured relational schema modeling core entities and relationships in the domain
- Constraints and rules to enforce data integrity (e.g., keys, relationships, validity)
- SQL queries representing real use cases (tracking, lookup, summaries, and reporting)

## Design notes
- **Normalization-first:** designed tables to reduce redundancy and prevent update anomalies.
- **Integrity and correctness:** used constraints to enforce rules at the database level.
- **Query-driven design:** evaluated schema choices based on the kinds of queries the system needs to support.
