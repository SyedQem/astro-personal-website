## Overview
A database-backed project built around a health and fitness domain using PostgreSQL and a Java ORM. The focus was designing a clean, normalized relational schema, enforcing data integrity, and supporting realistic queries that reflect real-world usage.

## What I built
- A normalized relational schema modeling core domain entities and their relationships
- ORM-based entity models to map domain objects cleanly to relational tables
- SQL queries representing practical workflows such as tracking, summaries, and reporting

## Design notes
- **Normalization-first:** designed tables to reduce redundancy and prevent update anomalies.
- **Integrity at the database layer:** enforced correctness using keys, constraints, and relationships.
- **ORM as a bridge:** used the ORM to balance object-oriented code with relational structure rather than hiding the database.

## Highlights
- Used PostgreSQL to support structured relational data with strong integrity guarantees
- Designed schema and queries around realistic access patterns rather than purely academic examples
