## Overview
This site is my personal hub for presenting projects and writing in a way that is simple, fast, and intentionally designed. I built it end-to-end with a focus on maintainability, clear information hierarchy, and minimal bloat.

## What I built
- A responsive, single-page layout with clear sections (Hero, About, Selected Projects)
- A design system built from reusable styles (e.g., consistent cards and “pill” tags)
- A project system that can scale over time (Projects index + individual write-ups)

## Design notes
- **Performance-first:** chose Astro for a lightweight, content-oriented build and minimal client-side overhead.
- **Maintainability:** kept the structure simple so adding projects and updating content stays frictionless.
- **Intentional tradeoffs:** optimized for clarity and speed over unnecessary animations or heavy UI frameworks.
