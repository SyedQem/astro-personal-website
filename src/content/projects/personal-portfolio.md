## Overview
A performance-focused personal portfolio built with Astro and TailwindCSS, designed to present my work clearly and professionally. I built and deployed the site end-to-end with an emphasis on clean structure, fast load times, and easy iteration.

## What I built
- A responsive layout with clear information hierarchy and consistent visual structure
- A projects system powered by Astro Content Collections (index + per-project deep dives)
- Continuous deployment via Vercel for fast iteration and reliable hosting

## Design notes
- **Performance-first:** chose Astro to minimize client-side JavaScript and keep pages lightweight.
- **Content-driven architecture:** structured the site so new projects are added via markdown, not UI rewrites.
- **Maintainability over flash:** prioritized clarity, accessibility, and long-term ease of updates.
