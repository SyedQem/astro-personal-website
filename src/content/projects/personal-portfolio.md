## Overview
A personal portfolio website focused on performance built with Astro and Tailwind CSS that's designed to present my work clearly and professionally for recruiters and interested people alike (like you!). I built and deployed the site end to end with an emphasis on clean code structure, fast load times, and easy iterative design.

## What I built
- A responsive layout with a clear information hierarchy and visuals that remain consistent
- A projects system powered by Astro Content Collections allowing for an index and deeper dives into projects
- Continuous deployment via Vercel for quick iteration and hosting that's reliable

## Design notes
- **Performance-first:** used Astro to minimize client-side JavaScript and to keep pages lightweight.
- **Content-driven architecture:** structured site so new projects are added via markdown, and not by having to rewrite the UI.
- **Maintainability over flash:** focused on clarity, accessibility, and long-term updateability.

## Future Design Plans
- **Dedicated About Section:** I plan to introduce a separate "about" section that will go further into detail about me, where I'm from and how I spend my free time.
